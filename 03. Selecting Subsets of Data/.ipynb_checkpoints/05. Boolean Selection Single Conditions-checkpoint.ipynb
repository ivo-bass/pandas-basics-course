    "## Boolean Selection\n",
    "Boolean Selection, also referred to as **Boolean Indexing**, is the process of selecting subsets of rows from DataFrames (or Series) based on the actual data values and NOT by their labels or integer locations. All of the previous subset selections where done using either labels or integer location and nothing to do with the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Boolean Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples of actual questions (in plain English) that boolean selection can help us answer from the bikes dataset. The term **query** is used to refer to these sorts of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find all rides by males\n",
    "* Find all rides with duration longer than 2 hours\n",
    "* Find all rides that took place between March and June of 2015.\n",
    "* Find all the rides with a duration longer than 2 hours by females with temperature higher than 90 degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "### All queries have a logical condition\n",
    "Each of the above queries have a strict logical condition that must be checked one row at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep or discard an entire row of data\n",
    "If you were to manually answer the above queries, you would need to scan each row and determine whether the row, as a whole, meets the condition. If so, then it is kept in the result, otherwise it is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Each row will have a True or False value associated with it\n",
    "When you perform boolean selection, each row of the DataFrame (or value of a Series) will have a `True` or `False` value associated with it that corresponds to the outcome of the logical condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Begin with a small DataFrame\n",

To signify which people are under 30, we create a list of 7 boolean values corresponding to the 7 rows in the DataFrame. The values in the list that correspond with the positions of `Niko`, `Aaron`, and `Penelope` are `True`. All other values are `False`. `Niko`, `Aaron`, and `Penelope` are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th rows, so these are the locations in the list that are `True`."

    "Instead of a list, we can use a Series of booleans, which will make the same selection. Below, we use the Series constructor to create a Series object. The Series must have the same index as the DataFrame it is selecting from in order to work properly, so we create it with the same index as the original DataFrame. This automatic alignment of the index is important and covered in the **Joining Data** part."
